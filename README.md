# smart_irrigation_system
The project was implemented by me and other three members under our college course. 
The project is based on the idea of embedded system and its applications. Here, we have used **Arduino UNO, soil moisture sensors, LCD, potentiometer** and many more equipments. Our main objective was to understand how the sensors record the input data i.e.resistance of soil and then using programming techniques to detect the level of moisture content in the soil by simple conversions.
